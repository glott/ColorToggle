# ColorToggle
_by Josh Glottmann_

**Version 1.5.2** - 09/12/2022

This is a lightweight software that allows you to switch vSTARS' map colors between those that would be used in a Terminal Controller Workstation (TCW) and a Tower Display Workstation (TDW).

vSTARS **must be closed** for this software to work properly.
